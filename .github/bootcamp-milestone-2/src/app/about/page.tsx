        <p>Hi Guys, my name is <strong>Rygel Fuentiblanca</strong> and I am a 2nd year Computer Engineering major, but I am hoping
        to switch to Computer Science this quarter. I am local as I am from <strong>Santa Maria</strong>, which is only about a 30-minute drive
        from Cal Poly. In my free time, I like to play video games, watch anime (Favorite: <strong>One Piece</strong>), go to the gym, and do some occasional fishing!</p>
