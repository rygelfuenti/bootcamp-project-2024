Prior to my first classes at Cal Poly, I had no experience whatsoever of programming, and I felt rather overwhelmed jumping into code on my first day of school.  From learning the basics like HTML, CSS, and Javascript to diving deeper into code like Data Structures and Algorithms, its easy to say that learning wasn't easy.  There have been many moments where I faced doubt, asking myself 'Am I Built For This', but I have also experienced major satisfaction from solving hard problems, and finally getting my code to work.   As I continue to grow and learn more about code, I hope to be the best developer I can be! </p>
