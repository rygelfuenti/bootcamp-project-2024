<p className="flex justify-center text-2xl text-gray-800 font--apple-system-">Hi Guys, my name is Rygel Fuentiblanca and I am a 2nd year Computer Engineering major, but I am hoping
        to switch to Computer Science this quarter. I am local as I am from Santa Maria, which is only about a 30-minute drive
        from Cal Poly. In my free time, I like to play video games, watch anime (Favorite: One Piece), go to the gym, and do some occasional fishing!</p>
